 Graphical  Password Authentication.

Course Project: Milestone 1 
The approved Course Project Proposal that was approved was the Graphical 
Password Authentication. I will be creating a password authentication program 
that will illustrate graphical password strategies that can make it easier for the 
user to access. 

To begin with this course project, the first step into creating a graphical password 
authenticator I need to download the preferred software of my choice for this 
project. The programming language I decided to work with was Python, the 
version of Spyder a lightweight IDE written in Python. To do this I needed to 
install Anaconda that offers a cross-platform Python distribution, it provided with 
the version of Spyder. After I had the software downloaded to my computer, the 
next step was to select the images I am going to use for the password 
authentication. The number of images I am going to use for this program is 5, but 
they had to be 5 diverse images of my choice. The images I wanted to use for 
password authenticator are like the password that will be used. The purpose of 
the multiple diverse images is to make sure that the user can successfully 
remember their password without having log in issues. After selecting the 
Gokhale 2 
images, I needed to make sure that they are put in the correct pathway for 
Python to be able to import the images. Once I had the 5 images needed, I had to 
ensure that Python had the correct Gui Programming toolkit to be able to create 
GUI applications. To be able to complete the first milestone, I had to ensure 
myself of the imports as it involves graphical user interfaces libraries and image 
processing. I will not be implementing the complete script as that is part of the 
process of the next milestones, I just needed the core of it. This allowed me to 
complete the first milestone of this Course Project.
